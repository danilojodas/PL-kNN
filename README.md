# PL-kNN
Thank you for being so interested in our research. This repository contains the source code of PL-kNN, a model proposed to bypass the choice of the k parameter of the standard k-NN classifier. The proposed model is based on the Smallest Modified k-Nearest Neighbors (SMKNN) presented by Ayyad et al. in the following paper:

**Ayyad, S. M., Saleh, A. I., & Labib, L. M. (2019). Gene expression cancer classification using modified K-Nearest Neighbors technique. *Biosystems*, 176, 41-51.**

Compared to the original SMKNN model, the proposed approach improves the class center calculation and the nearest neighbors' choice inside the circle enclosing the test sample. The model seeks the nearest neighbors using a semicircle computed as the distance between the test sample under analysis and the nearest class center of the training samples. This approach is efficient when there is a mixing of instances of different classes.

# Usage
